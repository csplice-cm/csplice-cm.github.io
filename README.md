# Introduction to the Working Group

Packaging materials is a generalized term to capture a broad array of tasks (creating,
revising, sharing, finding, crediting, etc.) for materials such as assignments, teacher notes, and
evaluation data. Substantial effort has gone into creating materials over the years, but the
community still struggles to find ways to effectively manage these. This Working Group is tasked
to develop a standard for curricular material creation and sharing, joining with broader
efforts of standardization (e.g., CSSPLICE) and existing initiatives
for creating repositories, tools, and materials.

# Original 2018 White Paper

# Terminology

We are the "Curriculum Materials" Working Group, although it is fine to say we are the "Curriculum Packaging" Working Group.

When abbreviating, regardless of whether you refer to us and the problem as "Curriculum Materials", "Curriculum Packaging", or "Curriculum Materials Packaging", the acronym is CM. This avoids certain unfortunate shortenings.
