*Abstract:* Packaging materials is a generalized term to capture a broad array of tasks (creating,
revising, sharing, finding, crediting, etc.) for materials such as assignments, teacher notes, and
evaluation data. Substantial effort has gone into creating materials over the years, but the
community still struggles to find ways to effectively manage these. This BoF provides an
opportunity to identify needs, concerns, prior efforts, and future plans. A primary goal is the
formation of a Working Group tasked to develop a standard for curricular material creation and
sharing, joining with broader efforts of standardization (e.g., CSSPLICE) and existing initiatives
for creating repositories, tools, and materials.

*Significance and Relevance of the topic:* Many instructors have experienced the pain points
surrounding the problem of packaging materials. New teachers are frequently handed a zip file
of course materials with minimal documentation, incomplete assignments, and actual student
data interspersed. Curriculum developers must find orderly ways to release their materials while
getting feedback on their usage. These scenarios, familiar to many instructors, impede progress
in our field as we continually reinvent the wheel. In the broader educational community,
initiatives like Open Educational Resources and Learning Objects provide potential frameworks,
but there are still opportunities to build on the technical expertise of our field. For example,
protocols like Git, combined with lightweight text formats (e.g., Markdown, YAML) could lead to
highly adaptable, accessible, and effective material packages. A proper standard could help
align efforts within CS Education to develop repositories of questions (e.g., The Canterbury
Question Bank), lessons (e.g., OpenDSA), assignments (e.g., Nifty Assignments), and other
tools (e.g., Ensemble). This process should start with a community discussion of our collective
challenges and experiences.

*About the Discussion Leader(s):*

Cory Bart is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science
at the University of Delaware with formal training in Instructional Design. He has been involved
in a number of course redesigns and created many curricular materials, while also experiencing
the pain of having materials handed to him. 

Michael Hilton is an Assistant Teaching Professor of
Computer Science at CMU, and has been involved in work to package curricular materials for
Software Engineering. 

Bob Edmison is the Director of Software Development of TLOS at
Virginia Tech, and has been involved in numerous efforts to study and revise curricular
materials for Learning Management Systems. 

Phill Conrad is a Senior Lecturer in Computer
Science at UC Santa Barbara. With his UCSB colleagues, he has piloted a curriculum
packaging system based on Jekyll and Markdown that can be hosted free of charge on Github
Pages.
